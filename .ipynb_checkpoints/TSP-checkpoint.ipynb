    "The minimal change of a route is a swap between two city routes (route[$(i-1)$%$N$],route[$i$]) and (route[$j$],route[$(j+1)$%$N$]), $i < j < N$, which trades the original city routes for (route[$(i-1)$%$N$],route[$j$]) and (route[$i$],route[$(j+1)$%$N$]), which is to reverse the city sequence from route[$i$] to route[$j$]. The swap makes sense only when the length of the reversed sequence is no longer than $N-2$, i.e. $j - i + 1 <= N - 2$ or $j - i < N - 2$.
